# The Accord Project

Accord provides the first open source Odette FTP 2.0 implementation - as a library component.
Now it aims at providing functionalities to ease the integration of business partners with
security and governance in mind. Project is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

## gxs-commpassion fork
The GXS (now OpenText) fork was created to allow a version that interoperates correctly with other versions of OFTP such as the Odex product from Data Interchange.
